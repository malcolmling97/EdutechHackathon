       "content": "# ☁️ Intro to Cloud Computing\n\nCloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet. Instead of owning and maintaining physical data centers, users can access computing services like servers, storage, and databases from cloud providers.\n\n## 🧠 Key Characteristics\n\n- **On-Demand Self-Service**: Users can provision resources as needed.\n- **Broad Network Access**: Services are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms.\n- **Resource Pooling**: Providers serve multiple customers using multi-tenant models.\n- **Rapid Elasticity**: Resources can be scaled up or down automatically.\n- **Measured Service**: Usage is monitored, controlled, and billed based on consumption.\n\n## 🏗️ Cloud Service Models\n\n- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Provides virtualized computing resources (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure VMs).\n- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: Offers a platform to develop, run, and manage applications (e.g., Google App Engine).\n- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Delivers software applications over the internet (e.g., Google Workspace, Salesforce).\n\n## 🌍 Deployment Models\n\n- **Public Cloud**: Services offered over the public internet.\n- **Private Cloud**: Cloud environment dedicated to a single organization.\n- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combines public and private cloud features.\n\n## 📦 Use Cases\n\n- Hosting web applications and websites.\n- Data backup and disaster recovery.\n- Big data analytics and machine learning workloads.\n- DevOps automation and CI/CD pipelines."
