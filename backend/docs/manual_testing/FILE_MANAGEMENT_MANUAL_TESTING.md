# File Management Manual Testing Guide

This document provides comprehensive manual testing instructions for the File Management functionality implemented for the EdutechHackathon backend API.

## Overview

The File Management system provides complete CRUD operations for file upload, storage, text extraction, and management. It supports PDF, DOCX, TXT, and MD files up to 25MB each with automatic text extraction for AI processing.

## Prerequisites

1. **Server Running**: Start the FastAPI development server
   ```bash
   cd EdutechHackathon/backend
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Authentication Token**: Get a valid JWT token through registration/login
3. **Test Files**: Prepare sample files (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD) for testing
4. **API Client**: Use curl, Postman, or similar tool

## Testing Endpoints

### 1. Authentication Setup

First, create a user account and get an authentication token:

```bash
# Register a new user
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "testpassword123",
    "name": "Test User"
  }'

# Login to get token
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "testpassword123"
  }'
```

**Expected Response**: Save the JWT token from the login response for subsequent requests.

### 2. Create Test Folder

Create a folder to upload files to:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/folders" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Test Files Folder",
    "description": "Folder for testing file operations"
  }'
```

**Expected Response**: 
- Status: `201 Created`

## File Processing Verification

### Text Extraction Testing

1. **PDF Files**: Upload PDF with text content
   - Verify extracted text appears in content endpoint
   - Check text quality and formatting

2. **DOCX Files**: Upload Word document
   - Verify text from paragraphs is extracted
   - Check table content extraction

3. **Text Files**: Upload plain text and markdown
   - Verify content is preserved exactly
   - Check encoding handling (UTF-8, etc.)

## Performance Testing

### Large File Handling

1. Upload files near the 25MB limit
2. Monitor processing time for text extraction
3. Verify system remains responsive

### Multiple File Upload

1. Upload 5-10 files simultaneously
2. Verify all files process correctly
3. Check for any race conditions

## Security Testing

### File Safety

1. Upload files with unusual names (special characters)
2. Verify path traversal protection
3. Test filename sanitization

### Access Control

1. Verify users can only access their own files
2. Test folder ownership enforcement
3. Confirm JWT token validation

## Database Verification

After running tests, verify database state:

```sql
-- Check file records
SELECT id, name, mime_type, size, deleted_at FROM files;

-- Check text extraction
SELECT id, name, LENGTH(text_content) as text_length FROM files;

-- Check soft deletion
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM files WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies installed
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **File Processing Errors**: Check if system dependencies are installed
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install libmagic1
   ```

3. **Permission Errors**: Verify upload/temp directories are writable
   ```bash
   chmod 755 uploads/ temp/
   ```

4. **Database Errors**: Ensure file model is imported
   ```python
   from app.models import file  # In database.py create_tables()
   ```

## Success Criteria

All tests should pass with:
- ‚úÖ Correct HTTP status codes
- ‚úÖ Proper error messages for failures
- ‚úÖ Complete file metadata in responses
- ‚úÖ Successful text extraction for supported formats
- ‚úÖ Proper access control enforcement
- ‚úÖ File storage in correct locations
- ‚úÖ Database records created correctly
